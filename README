# CrewAI-JS: Unofficial JavaScript SDK üöÄ

**CrewAI-JS** is an unofficial SDK inspired by the [CrewAI Python framework](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI). This library brings the multi-agent AI system experience to JavaScript/TypeScript, allowing developers to orchestrate AI agents, tasks, and workflows in Node.js or browser environments.

## Why CrewAI-JS? ü§î

I was working on a project that required leveraging large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 in JavaScript. However, after searching, I found no existing frameworks or SDKs for this in the JavaScript ecosystem. I came across discussions where people expressed interest in building something similar, but no one had started.

That‚Äôs why I began building **CrewAI-JS**‚Äîa framework where developers can easily work with AI agents, especially for projects that integrate LLMs, without needing to reinvent the wheel.

## How Does It Work?

CrewAI-JS replicates the core functionality of CrewAI but for JavaScript. It introduces:
- **Agents**: Autonomous entities that can handle tasks using LLMs (e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4).
- **Tasks**: Assign specific goals for agents to execute.
- **Crews**: Orchestrate the collaboration between multiple agents to achieve a common goal.

## Project Goals ‚ú®

This project is just getting started, but the vision is to have a fully operational multi-agent system that supports various LLMs, including OpenAI models and local ones in the future. We're building it to be highly modular and developer-friendly.

Contributions and feedback are welcome! Whether you want to improve the core, suggest features, or help with documentation‚Äîyour input is valuable!

## Inspired by CrewAI Python Framework üêç

CrewAI-JS is directly inspired by the [CrewAI Python framework](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI), which has shown great success in orchestrating complex multi-agent workflows using LLMs. This JavaScript version aims to bring that same power to the JS ecosystem, bridging the gap for developers working with LLMs.

## How to Get Started

```bash
npm install crewai-js
```

## Contributions

CrewAI-JS is open for contributions! If you have ideas, suggestions, or bug reports, feel free to create an issue or open a pull request.

Let‚Äôs build the future of AI agent orchestration in JavaScript together! üåü
